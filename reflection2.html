		<p>This poster was then transformed into a “zine” (what is a zine anyways?) aka a series of “just because I love you cards”. I love the early internet, and want to share that with other people. Thinking about nostalgia and childhood and my experiences with the web during those times reminded me of how exciting Valentine’s Day was in elementary school. Everyone would come in with cards and candy for everyone in the class, for once Valentine’s Day wasn’t about romantic love, but sharing something with the community of the classroom.</p>

    <p>Thinking about GIFs as time based media, I was interested in breaking them apart into frames to observe the subtle in-between moments. I cut out each frame into squares, folded and collaged patterned backgrounds, and just threw everything on the copy machine scanner and let the chaos of it all inform the design output. I measured a standard Valentine’s day card and cut a view finder matching that size. I used this a framing device to cut various areas and patterns from my collaged sheets. <a href="https://www.are.na/joey-petrillo/joey-unmaking">See more process and instructions on are.na.</a></p>
