    <p class="center ital">&ldquo;Oh, I love to love, But my baby just loves to dance, He wants to dance,<br>he loves to dance, he's got to dance&rdquo;<p>
      <p class="center spacer">— <span class="ital">I Love to Love,</span> Tina Charles</p>
		<p>I love the internet, and it breaks my heart to see it slowly shift from an infinite playground to a sterile shopping mall. I’m terrified of web4.0 and the Metaverse, as these tech giants get larger, the web seems to get smaller. What seemed like a vast expanse of limitless possibilities now feels a handful of templated social media sites, which restrict and manipulate us into addictive gamified patterns and our interactions monetized. In <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/"><span class="ital">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</span></a>, Laurel Schwulst claims, “Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future. The web is called the web because its vitality depends on just that—an interconnected web of individual nodes breathing life into a vast network. This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google”.</p><p>Using Tina Charles’s 1976 disco ballad <span class="ital">I Love to Love</span> as a metaphor, this poster serves as a nostalgic love letter that celebrates and pleads for a return to the age of personal websites. Here “baby” is the web—we want to feel connected, but Silicon Valley dictates that innovation and spectacle take precedent in order for these communal platforms to be monetized. By searching “love” on <a href="https://gifcities.org/?q=love">gifcities</a>, which searches the Geocities archive for gifs with matching file names, I posed the question: how did we used to express our love on our personal pages? I believe gifs are packed with emotion—the low frame rate, compression, and clunky animation are all imperfections that show the human hand.</p><p>This poster was hand-coded with no initial sketch, the design was informed fully by the tools of a text editor and the browser. I remember learning HTML to edit my Neopets and MySpace pages in middle school—like many others in my generation, my introduction to code was as a creative output. The code on this site is a mess—every element is tagged and carefully placed—but I believe that complicated code can be beautiful. I believe hand coding can be craft, and the imperfections of clunky CSS reveal the love and care with which the site was made.</p>
